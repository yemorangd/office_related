# Vertica column name referencing

In case of applying renaming a column with the same column name as the original column name,
further selection of that column may cause unexpected behavior within same SELECT clause.

for example...
------------------------------
SELECT do_something(a) as a
      ,CASE WHEN A ~~~ THEN B
            WHEN A ~~~ THEN C
            ...
            END AS Z
        FROM some_table
------------------------------
In this case, later CASE clause still references original column A from some_table,
which function do_soemthing wasn't appllied.

First of all, you better not rename a column to the same name it started with.
In case of further references are too big ordeal to alter, than have SELECT - RENAME part as a subquery.

# Monthly updated tables
You'd better not forget it's monthly update cycles.
It is mostly based on business dates, which is quite counter-intuitive.
Opt to use daily/master tables rather than monthly/historical tables.

# be case sensitive
I know Teradata's CASE INSENSITIVE was such a strong option to manage tables,
however it didn't carried over to Vertica.
Assert upper/lower cases or be meticulous on handling alphabetic characters in your query.
